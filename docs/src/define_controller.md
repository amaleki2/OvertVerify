## Define controller
Next step is to define the neural network controller. Currently, OvertVerify supports
fully connected neural networks with ReLU activation functions. The last layer may have a linear activation function. The controller should be prescribed as `nnet` file. To see the detail of this representation, check [this](https://github.com/sisl/NNet) out.
